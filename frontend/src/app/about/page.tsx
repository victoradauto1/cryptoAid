          CryptoAid is a Web3 crowdfunding platform built as a portfolio project
          to demonstrate the practical application of blockchain technology in
          real-world use cases. The platform showcases how smart contracts can
          replace intermediaries, automate trust, and create transparent digital
          funding environments.

          Project Purpose
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#6b6b6b]">
          The main objective of CryptoAid is to explore decentralized architecture,
          on-chain logic, and smart contract integration within a modern frontend
          application. Rather than being a commercial fundraising platform, this
          project exists as a technical study and demonstration of Web3 development
          principles.
          <br />
          <br />
          It reflects an understanding of how blockchain systems can be used to
          enhance transparency, automate conditional logic, and remove reliance
          on centralized control.

          Design Philosophy
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-[#6b6b6b]">
          CryptoAid was designed with clarity and minimalism in mind. The goal
          was to create a clean interface that makes decentralized interactions
          feel intuitive and accessible. The platform balances modern UI principles
          with blockchain functionality, ensuring that the technical layer does
          not overwhelm the user experience.

          CryptoAid is a portfolio project created for educational and
          demonstrative purposes. It does not represent a live financial product,
          and no real-world guarantees are implied. The project exists to
          illustrate Web3 architecture, smart contract integration, and frontend
          engineering in a decentralized environment.
